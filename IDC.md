# IDC development platform

Leverages ISLE to provide a local development environment for the IDC stack, with particular focus on development/testing of
the Drupal site.

## Contents

* Our Drupal site is in `codebase`.
  * Use `composer` to add, remove, or update dependencies in `codebase/composer.json` and `codebase/composer.lock` when developing
  * Dependencies are not vendored, so you need to do a composer install.  This is included in `make bootstrap`
* IDC development-specific environment variables are in `.env` and `docker-compose.env.yml`
* An idc-specific Makefile `idc.Makefile` defines additional make targets available for `make

## Quick Start

To start the IDC development environment, run

    make up

This will build a `docker-compose` file, run `composer install` to locally install all dependencies for our site (which will
take a few minutes when done the first time, but will be much quicker subsequent times), and start the stack.  The stack will
start from a known snapshot state, which currently is an entirely empty (but initialized) Drupal.

To reset to a known Drupal state, run

    docker-compose down -v
    docker-compose up -d

This will remove all content from volumes that you may have added, launch using the snapshot as its initial state.

To dump the site's configuration so that it can be committed to `git`, do

    make config-export

To take a snapshot of Drupal's current content, do

    make snapshot

See [snapshots](#snapshots) for more information on how to make and publish snapshots

## Make targets

There are several Make targets in the `Makefile`, and its idc-specific companion `idc.Makefile` (which are included by default,
so no need to do anything special other than `make` to invoke them).  A few useful targets are as follows:

* **make bootstrap** Burn everything down and create a fresh installation from scratch, deleting any pre-existing data, and starting from a completely empty state.  Only the list of modules in `composer.json` (and dependencies in `composer.lock`) survives the process.
* **make reset** Burn everything down and create a fresh installation _from the snapshot image_.  Unlike `make bootstrap`, modules and dependencies **do not** survive; they will be installed when the drupal container starts.  Does not pull in configuration from config/sync, will use the active configuration present in the snapshot.
* **make composer-install**  Use the Drupal container to run a `composer install`.  This avoids having to install composer on your local system.
* **make cache-rebuild** Uses Drush inside the Drupal container to rebuild Drupal's cache.
* **make config-export** Exports all current active Drupal config to the `codebase/config/sync` directory, so that it can be committed to git.
* **make snapshot** Create a snapshot of the current Drupal state (db, content files, etc), so that you can reset to this state at will, or push it so that others can.
* **make snapshot-push** Push the current snapshot image to the container registry
* **make up** Brings up the development environment, including running `composer install`.

A few specialized targets are:

* **make static-docker-compose.yml** Make a docker-compose.yml based off non-development "static" environment.  Notably:
  * A `drupal-static` image is built or pulled, which has `codebase` baked in, and is used in place of the normal `drupal` image
  * `codebase` is no longer bind mounted
* **make static-drupal-image** builds (or pulls, if published) a "static" drupal image suitable for deployment in the cloud.  This image:
  * Has the contents of `codebase` baked into it, as well as all dependencies via `composer install`
  * Will load its config from `config/sync` upon startup
  * Is named `drupal-static` and is tagged based on `git describe --tags`.

## Snapshots

Snapshots are Docker images that contain Drupal state (content files, database, SOLR indexes, Fedora files, etc).  When Docker starts,
all Docker volumes will be populated with files from the snapshot image.  The net result is that an environment will start quickly,
from a known state, with pre-populated content.

After Docker starts from a snapshot, data subsequent in Docker's volumes is ephemeral.  It will persist across `stop` and `down`, but can be wiped out by

    docker-compose down -v

When docker subsequently starts, it will start from the known snapshot state.  You are free to [take a snapshot](#taking-and-publishing-snapshots)
whenever you want a checkpoint you can reliably reset Drupal to.

### Images

The image used for the snapshot is specified via environment variables in `.env`.  For example:

    # Docker image and tag for snapshot image
    SNAPSHOT_IMAGE=birkland/snapshot
    SNAPSHOT_TAG=upstream-20201007-739693ae-12-ga409e4d8.1602146397

When the `docker-compose.yml` make target is run, that image and tag will be specified in the docker-compose file.  The images contain data that are
copied to Docker volumes upon initial startup of the stack (i.e. snapshots are deployed only once, until all volumes are wiped out via `docker-compose down -v`).  Because they are just regular docker images, they can be pushed and puled from container registry as usual.

### Taking and publishing snapshots

To take a snapshot, run

    make snapshot

This will do the following:

* stop the docker-compose stack
* dump the contents of the volumes
* create a new image from the contents of the volume
* give the image a unique tag based on the current git commit, and the date
* update the `.env` file to specify the just-taken `SNAPSHOT_TAG`
* rebuild the `docker-compose.yml` file to specify that tag
* start docker-compose

If you want to commit that snapshot so that others can use it, you need to commit `.env` (which contains the tag of the snapshot image),
and publish the snapshot image to a Docker registry via

    make snapshot-push

Make sure you do both steps!  You need to push the image (so others can pull it), and push `.env` (so others can check out and run it).

# SAML Configuration

Drupal incorporates its own SAML Service Provider using [SimpleSAMLphp][simplesaml]; an Apache-based SP proxy (c.f. PASS SAML configuration) is _not_ used, and would be incompatible with Drupal.  The SimpleSAMLphp SP will be used in development and production environments (including all cloud-based instances).

The developer environment includes a mock Shibboleth Identity Provider (IdP) and LDAP user store to serve as a backend for user attributes.  These services would also be used when running integration tests, e.g. as a part of a PR or locally-executed tests.  The production environment would _not_ deploy these mock services.

SimpleSAMLphp has an administrative [web interface][simplesaml-webadmin] which supports:
  * diagnostics and configuration testing
  * testing logins, including viewing attribute assertions by the IdP
  * SP metadata generation (used to generate SP `EntityDescriptor` XML used by Shibboleth IdPs)
  * IdP XML metadata conversion (used to transform Shibboleth IdP metadata for use by SimpleSAMLphp)

Clicking on the Federation tab, and then click on the link labeled [Show metadata][sp-gen-md] under the heading “SAML 2.0 SP Metadata” will generate the SAML metadata to provide to the IdP. Testing authentication and attributes presented by the IdP is best performed using this admin interface.

Runtime parameterization of the IdP and SP is accomplished using a mixture of environment variables and secrets.  Two containers use these secrets: the `idp` and `drupal` containers.  Secrets are defined in `docker-compose.yml` from the consitutient service definitions in `docker-compose.saml.yml` and `docker-compose.local.yml`.

For a deeper understanding of SAML certificate roles, this [primer][cert-primer] may help.

## SAML Secrets

It should be said immediately that not every key/value pair in the `saml-secrets.yml` file is strictly a secret.  For example, public keys (in the form of X509 certs) would not be considered a secret.  However, to facilitate uniform processing of private/public key _pairs_ and other values, using a single secrets file together with the `confd` `file` backend makes sense.  `saml-secrets.yml` uses a structure well-known to the containers that process its contents.  Renaming, removing, or adding keys may impact the processing of its content by the `idp` or `drupal` containers.

In the Docker environment, there are unfortunate layers of indirection when it comes to the use of secrets.

First and foremost, secrets are defined in `docker-compose.yml`, which is formed by constituent service files including `docker-compose.local.yml` (which defines the `drupal` service) and `docker-compose.saml.yml` (which defines the `idp` service).  The first indirection decouples the _location_ of the secret from the _name_ of the secret: the secrets are exposed to the containers by their _name_, independent of their location in the repository.

Generally, a named secret defines a single value.  The exception is the secret named `saml_secrets`; it contains multiple secrets.  This is the second indirection, whereby a single named secret can securely expose multiple secret values.  (This is in order to leverage the `file` [backend][file-backend] of [confd][confd])  Values in `saml-secrets.yml` may themselves be environment variables, which must be processed before they are used.  This is the third indirection.

Finally, some values from `saml_secrets` may be written out to files.  This depends on the capabilities of the consumer: some read configuration values inline, others read them from files.

### SAML env and secrets processing

Two containers use SAML env vars and secrets: the `idp` container (the mock Shibboleth Identity Provider) and the `drupal` container (SimpleSAMLphp Service Provider).  Secrets are defined in their accompanying docker-compose files, `docker-compose.local.yml` and `docker-compose.saml.yml`.

There are a number of files which contribute to the SAML environment, distributed across the `idc-isle-dc` and `idc-isle-buildkit` repositories, and multiple methods used for processing.  The complexity is high for a couple of reasons:
  * multiple applications with different runtimes (java, nginx/php) consume the same SAML parameters (e.g. the cert used to sign SAML assertions is referenced by both the SP and IdP)
  * a single application will use the same parameter inline as well as consume it from a file (so if you want to change a value, and only want to change it in one place, some hoops need to be jumped through)

An example may help: you wish to know how/where the IdP signing key is used.  Using the table above, a starting point would be to search the `idc-isle-buildkit` repo for occurrences of `idp/signing-key` key.  The only hits will be `confd` configuration, where you see that it is written out to `/tmp/idp_signing`.  Perform a second search for `/tmp/idp_signing`, and you'll see it used in the `idp.properties` `confd` template (which in turn writes `idp.properties` to `/opt/shibboleth-idp/conf/idp.properties`).

A second, more complex example: you wish to know how/where the IdP signing cert is used.  Using the table, start by searching the `idc-isle-buildkit` repo for occurrences of `idp/signing-cert` key.  You'll see it referenced by a couple of `confd` templates which in turn will lead you to `idp.properties` (references the value in the file `/tmp/idp_signing.crt`) and `idp-metadata.xml` (the value is used inline).  You will also want to perform a similar search of the `idc-isle-dc` repository.  To cast a wide net, search for the string `signing-cert` (you'll get some hits from both the SP and IdP).  You'll note that the file `shib13-idp-remote.php` uses PHP to parse the value from the `saml_secrets` YAML structure (essentially inline use).  As things evolve, I do not expect the table below to be kept up-to-date, so it is worth understanding how to discover where and how various secrets are used.

Tips:
* Search in both repositories
* Cast a wide net: searching for `/saml-secrets/idp/signing-cert` is not going to find hits in PHP code that reference `[saml-secrets][idp][signing-cert]`
* If `confd` writes the value to a file, perform a subsequent search for references to the file.
* Having a general understanding of the SAML protocol helps:  for example, encryption or signing keys shouldn't be shared between two different containers, but public keys (i.e. those used for verifying signatures) would be.

#### IdP env and secrets processing

The IdP entrypoint uses `confd` to interpolate a number of configuration files that dictate SAML request processing.  Because `saml_secrets` can use environment variables as secret values, the configuration files are subsequently processed through `envsubst`.

Note that the IdP configuration files may refer to any named secrets that are exposed by Docker, not just the secrets present in `saml_secrets`.

Finally, processing logic occurs in the `idp` entrypoint which resides in the `idc-isle-buildkit` repository.  Secrets are defined in the `idc-isle-dc` repository.  The names of secrets are shared between the two repositories; if the name of a secret changes, it must be changed in both.

#### SP env and secrets processing

The Service Provider (SimpleSAMLphp) runs in the `drupal` container, installed as a vendored `composer` dependency.  A number of PHP configuration files have been modified to reference secrets and environment variables where it makes sense.  For example, in `config.php` `'assertion.allowed_clock_skew' => 180` has been changed to `'assertion.allowed_clock_skew' => intval(getenv('DRUPAL_SP_ASSERTIONALLOWEDCLOCKSKEW'))`.  Instead of inlining certificates, `shib-13-idp-remote.php` parses `saml_secrets`.  These modifications reside in a patch file managed in the `idc-isle-dc` repository.

The PHP interpreter executes under PHP-FPM, therefore environment variables must be explicitly passed from NGINX.  Confd is used to process SP-related environment variables (using the env backend) and expose them to PHP-FPM via the include file `drupal_sp_fastcgi_params`.  Confd is executed on container start, and is managed in the `idc-isle-buildkit` repository.
